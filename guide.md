## Phase 1: Project Setup and Window Creation

### Step 1: Initialize Your Project

```bash
mkdir my-game-engine
cd my-game-engine
go mod init github.com/yourusername/my-game-engine
```

### Step 2: Install Core Dependencies

```bash
go get github.com/go-gl/glfw/v3.3/glfw

- Frame-based animation
- Animation state machine
- Sprite sheet support

## Phase 6: Advanced Rendering

### Step 17: Tilemap Renderer

- Tile-based collision detection
- Multiple layer support

### Step 18: Particle System

Basic particle effects:

- Particle emitter system

- Particle pooling for performance

### Step 19: Text Rendering

Add text support:

- Bitmap font loading
- Text rendering with proper spacing
- Font atlas generation
- Basic text formatting

## Phase 7: Audio System

### Step 20: Audio Foundation

Choose and integrate audio library:

- Options: Oto, PortAudio bindings, or Beep
- Audio context setup
- Sound loading (WAV, OGG)
- Basic playback functionality

### Step 21: Audio Management

Build audio system:

- Sound effect management
- Music streaming
- Volume control
- 3D audio positioning (optional)

## Phase 8: Asset Management

### Step 22: Resource Manager

Create asset loading system:

- Asset loading interfaces
- Caching system
- Async loading (using goroutines)
- Asset hot reloading for development

### Step 23: Content Pipeline

Build content tools:

- Texture packing utilities
- Asset validation
- Build scripts for asset processing
- Development vs production asset handling

## Phase 9: Physics and Collision

### Step 24: Basic 2D Physics

Implement simple physics:

- Rigidbody component
- Basic collision shapes (AABB, circles)
- Collision detection algorithms
- Simple physics integration

### Step 25: Physics World

Create physics simulation:

- Physics world management
- Collision response
- Trigger volumes
- Spatial partitioning for optimization

## Phase 10: Development Tools

### Step 26: Debug Rendering

Add development features:

## Key Design Principles

1. **Start Simple**: Begin with basic functionality and iterate
2. **Modular Design**: Keep systems loosely coupled
3. **Performance Aware**: Profile early and often
4. **Cross-Platform**: Design with portability in mind
5. **Developer Experience**: Build tools that make game development enjoyable

## Learning Resources

- OpenGL tutorials (learnopengl.com)
- Go graphics programming examples
- Game engine architecture books
- 2D game development patterns

## Expected Timeline

- **Weeks 1-2**: Phases 1-4 (Basic rendering and game loop)
- **Weeks 3-4**: Phases 5-6 (Core systems and advanced rendering)
- **Weeks 5-6**: Phases 7-8 (Audio and asset management)
- **Weeks 7-8**: Phases 9-10 (Physics and tools)
- **Weeks 9-10**: Phase 11 (Optimization and polish)

This timeline assumes working on it part-time. Adjust based on your available time and experience level.

## Next Steps

Start with Phase 1 and work through each step methodically. Don't rush to add features - a solid foundation will make everything else easier. Focus on getting each phase working well before moving to the next.

Remember: building a game engine is a marathon, not a sprint. Take time to understand each concept thoroughly, and don't hesitate to build small test games along the way to validate your engine's design.
